# IJC445 - Analysing Temporal Popularity Trends for Selected Musical Genres
This repository contains the necessary file related to IJC445 - Data Visualisation coursework

This project explores popularity trends for selected musical genres over time. The genres drawing comparisons in this project are pop, hip hop, dance pop, disco, contemporary country, classic soul, rock and roll, Canadian pop, boy band, and classic UK pop. A total of 6 plots have been created as part of this project, each exploring a different aspect of the popularity trends. This project helps in building visualisations that help understand trends present in the data. It helps in drawing inferences from the visualisation, enhancing interpretability skills.
This project uses the MusicOset dataset. This dataset contains a wide range of data with respect to songs, albums, artists, lyrics, metadata and more
Data files such as Artists, Songs, Song Chart, Releases, Tracks, and Acoustic Features are used in this project to analyse song popularity across genres over time.

# Special Instructions
After running line 172, the visualisation opens on on the viewer tab. Once the visualisation is up, I would recommend exploring the interactive plot by adding / removing genres from the chart by clicking on the genre names displayed on the legend at right side of the plot. Selected genres appears highlighted. You can also adjust the year range by using the slider at the bottom of the plot.
